How to build a NYTimes Digits style app in React Native

**Quick context:** I built a math game for iOS in 2022 called [MinuteBeat - Numbers](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/minutebeat-numbers/id1614527068). Then in April 2023, The NYTimes released their own version of the game called [Digits](https://www.nytimes.com/games/digits). I was excited to see the concept catch on so I thought I'd make a guide for others to build their own versions too!
